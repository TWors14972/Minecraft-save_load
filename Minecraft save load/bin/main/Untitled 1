TODO

Add multi-select options:
send to zip (replaces save with zip)
copy to zip (leaves save unzipped, but makes zipped copy)
copy unzip (creates a copy and unzips it, leaving the zipped version)
unzip (unzips original save)
delete (completely deletes selected item(s), replace old save feature)

Replace delete, only use 1 button to accept (Save under save, Delete under delete, etc.)

Use drop-down list instead of radio buttons, have internal menu?
